#Setting up Eclipse project

= Eclipse Setup =

* 1. SVN checkout*
[http://code.google.com/p/taglocate/source/checkout See here.] 

* 2. Import projects*
Make sure to have both the !TagLocate as well as the !NfcMimeLib project added to your workspace. You may need to add !NfcMimeLib manually to !TagLocate as Android project library: This can be done in the 'Android' part of the project properties under 'Libraries'.

* 3. Dependencies*
I'm planning to use Maven at some point, but for now, you'll need to add the following jars manually to the build path:

 * [http://commons.apache.org/codec/download_codec.cgi Apache Commons Codec]
 * [http://commons.apache.org/io/download_io.cgi Apache Commons IO]
 * [http://commons.apache.org/lang/download_lang.cgi Apache Commons Lang]
 * [http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/downloads/detail?name=guice-2.0-no_aop.jar&can=2&q= Guice 2.0 (no AOP version)]
 * [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/roboguice/roboguice/1.1.2/ Roboguice (1.1.2)]
 * [http://simple.sourceforge.net/download.php Simple XML]
