	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	<p>Tag Locate is a demonstrator application for object-based indoor positioning, focusing mainly on NFC 
	technology. However, it also supports QR codes.</p>
	
	<h3>How to locate</h3>
	<p><i><b>NFC</b></i>: Put the device against a NFC tag that contains location information while the app is running. <br>
	<i><b>QR</b></i>: Press menu key, select "QR Locate". <a href="market://details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android">'Barcode Scanner'</a> 
	must be installed for this to work.</p>
	
	<h3>Tag data format</h3>
	<p>Tag Locate supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_URI">Geo-URI's</a> as well as 
	<a href="http://magun.beuth-hochschule.de">iii-URI's</a> containing a Geo-URI target element.<br>
	For QR-codes, use <a href="http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/">'Geo-QR code'</a>, which is basically a Geo-URI.</p>
	
	<h3>ID resolution</h3>
	<p>In addition to explicit location URI's written on the tags, the unique ID of NFC tags may also be used for getting a
	location. In this case, the application uses a reference file that links those ID's with coordinates. QR codes may also be
	used as ID's, in which case their specific content will be no further evaluated. See the default reference file 
	(/sdcard/taglocate/default.iir) for more information.</p>
	
	<h3>Resolution strategies</h3>
	<p>There are multiple strategies to get location information out of tags:<br><br>
	<i><b>ID first:</b></i> The tag will only be evaluated for an explicit location link, if it's ID cannot
	be found in the link file.<br>
	<i><b>Link first:</b></i> The ID will only be looked up if the tag doesn't contain an explicit location link.<br>
	<i><b>ID only:</b></i> Only the ID will be evaluated.<br>
	<i><b>Link only:</b></i> Only the payload data will be evaluated.</p>
	
	<h3>Files</h3>
	<p>The /taglocate/ folder on the SD card contains geometry files and link files. You can define your
	own files here. Note that the geometry files currently use a very simplistic <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/XML">OSM format</a>, only 
	supporting 'node' and 'way' elements.</p>
	
	<h3>File download from NFC</h3>
	<p>It is possible to store geometry and link files on NFC tags. Those files may be downloaded and 
	applied. To create a NFC tag containing files, put the desired files into a ZIP archive and write
	the archive's byte array into a NDEF record using the MIME declaration 'application/zip'.</p>
	
	<h3>Reference new Tags</h3>
	<p>To reference new NFC tags or QR codes, select 'Add Tag' from the options menu. A crosshairs symbol
	will appear in the center of the map. Move the view so that the symbol marks the location you want to
	associate with the tag. Select 'Add Tag here'. Now you can choose between: <br><br>
	<b><i>'Write NFC Tag': </i></b>The location will be written to a NFC tag using a Geo-URI.<br>
	<b><i>'Reference NFC ID': </i></b>The tag's ID will be associated with a location within the local
	reference model (i.e. IIR file). If the ID has already been referenced, the reference will be updated
	with the new location.<br>
	<b><i>'Reference QR Code': </i></b>The QR code will be referenced in the local reference model just 
	like a NFC ID. So make sure the QR's content is unique.<br>
